## Introduction 

This vignette is written with graduate students in mind. The intent is to get graduate students and other collaborators who may not be familiar with data analysis with R and RStudio up and running doing basic analysis of the BBO datasets in as little time as possible. This vinette covers the basics of how to use R, RStudio, and the `BBOTools` package to analyse the CME's BBO datasets. First download and install R from [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/), then download and install RStudio from [https://www.rstudio.com/](https://www.rstudio.com/). Before continuing, it is expected the reader will have completed an extensive introductory R tutorial. There are several available.  

1. [http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction)

2. [https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)

3. [http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/)

4. [http://tryr.codeschool.com/](http://tryr.codeschool.com/)

There are other others, but this is a start. For one's own research it is required that you will go much deeper than what is covered in these introductory tutorials, but hopefully you will come out of the tutorials with an ability to Google what you want to do and how to implement it in R. This package makes heavy use of the `data.table` package. The `data.table` package was written with careful memory management in mind. Since we are working with large files, memory management is essential. Read the excellent series of vinettes for the [data.table package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html) for details about how `data.table` makes efficient use of memory verses data.frames. The rest of this vinette will assume the reader has at least installed the latest version of R and RStudio. IF you are familar with R and RStudio, skip ahead to [The BBOTools Package][].

## Set Up Your First Project

In Rstudio, click "New Project" from the File menu. You will see a menu like the following:

![New Project](images/newproj.png)

Choose "New Directory", and then "Empty Project". You will be asked to navigate to the place where you want your project folder to reside. This creates a file in the directory you chose named `YourProject.Rproj`. Assuming you named your project 'YourProject'. This should be the first step on any analysis in R. Working within the framework of an R Project tells RStudio where to put things by default. Without it, the default working directory will inevitably end up being something unintuitive or unexpected, and you will have to tell your R code hard file paths everytime you want to refer to a data file or code script. This makes working accross machines or with collaborators difficult because you have to change the file path everytime you are on a different machine. 

[Table of Contents][]

## Your First R Script

Open a new R script file by clicking the green '+' icon below the File menu in RStudio. 

![New Script](images/newscript.png)

Follow along by copy and pasting the commands from this vinette into your R script and executing the commands. To execute a command, place the cursor on the line you want to execute and click "Run". In the figure below, executing line 2 will assign a value of '1' to 'x'.

## The BBOTools Package 

This package provides tools for working with the Top-of-the-Book (Best Bid-Offer) datasets from the CME Group's [Historical Datamine](http://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/datamine-historical-data.html#topOfBookBbo). These data provide record of every revision to the best bid or best offer. These revisions may have resulted from a new limit order arriving to the market, a limit order being cancelled, or a transaction matching a market order with a limit order or a limit order with another limit order. 

The raw data provided by the CME Group are organized as large fixed-width files. The files are large enough that if one is not careful about memory use, even simple analyses becomes a problem. An extention of R's base data.frame called [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki) was recently developed by [Matt Dowle](https://github.com/mattdowle) and [Arun Srinivasan](https://github.com/arunsrinivasan) makes working with large datasets in R much more feasible. 

This package utilizes the data.table package extensively. Most of the functions in the BBOTools package are simple wrapper functions that make working with the BBO data more convenient.

## BBOTools as a Private GitHub Repository

Currently, BBOTools is hosted in a private repository in the [ProfMalloryResearch](https://github.com/ProfMalloryResearch) GitHub repsository. To use this package you will need to have a GitHub account and be added to the [ProfMalloryResearch](https://github.com/ProfMalloryResearch) organization. If we plan to collaborate, contact Mindy Mallory to be added.  

Even after being added to the organization you will still need to generate a personal access token from GitHub in order to authenticate and install packages from this private organization. Further, you will want to save it in such a way that it will not be publicly visible anywhere but on your local machine.  

Steps to get a PAT

1. Go to your account settings on GitHub.com
2. Click 'Personal Access Tokens'
3. Click 'Generate New Token'
4. You will have a long string of numbers that is your token. 

You want to save it in a place that will not be accessible to the public in any way. For example, you don't want it to get uploaded to a public (or even private) repository on GitHub.com. 

Steps to save your PAT in a safe place. 

1. Find out what R's 'home' directory is on your machine. 
    + execute `normalizePath("~/")` in the R console. The file identified is where you should save a plain text file called .Renvirion
2. Navigate to and open the .Renviron in a plain text editor. 
3. Type the following: GITHUB_PAT = "StringofnumbersthatisyourPAT"
4. Save .Renviron

Your PAT should be stored in a safe place and accessible from the R console. To check execute the following r code:
`Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT")`
You should see your own PAT in the output.

## Installing BBOTools from GitHub

Now to install the package `BBOToolkit` from [ProfMalloryResearch](https://github.com/ProfMalloryResearch) execute the following r code:

```
install_github("ProfMalloryResearch/BBOToolkit", auth_token = Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT")) 
library(BBOTools)
```

This installs and loads the BBOTools package into your R environment.

## Importing BBO Data with bboread()

The CME Group offers a sample of the BBO data. Go to [Historical Datamine](http://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/datamine-historical-data.html#topOfBookBbo) and download the corn futures bbo data sample. Extract the compressed file to your R project folder so that the file `XCBT_C_FUT_110110.TXT` resides in your project folder.

Next, make sure you have installed and loaded the `data.table` and `readr` packages. 

```{r , warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#install.packages("data.table")
#install.packages("readr")
library(data.table)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(BBOTools)

```

Next, lets load the sample BBO data and take a look at it. 

```{r}
DATA <- as.data.table(bboread('XCBT_C_FUT_110110.TXT'))
DATA

```
This loads the sample BBO data into your R environment as a `data.table` object. The use of the `as.data.table()` function here is important because without it the data get loaded as a `data.frame` object. 

```
DATA <- bboread('XCBT_C_FUT_110110.TXT')
DATA

```
Notice the difference in the way the object, `DATA`, displays as a data.table in the first case and a data.frame in the second case. To clean up our memory after that example, remove the `DATA` variable and load it again as a data.table.

```
rm(DATA)
DATA <- as.data.table(bboread('XCBT_C_FUT_110110.TXT'))
DATA

```
Click on the `DATA` variable in the 'Environment' tab in RStudio. This displays the data.table object in a spreadsheet-like display. The `bboread()` function only imported the data columns we need for analyzing this data. The raw data contains many additional columns that are unnecesary for our purposes. If you want to see the full dataset, look at the documentation for using the `read_fwf()` function of the [readr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/index.html) package. 

We have imported the following data columns:

```{r}
names(DATA)

```

## Data Description

**TradeDate and EntryDate**

`EntryDate` refers to the date on which the trade was placed, while `TradeDate` refers to the settlement date associated with those trades. These are character strings representing dates in the format `%YYYY%mm%dd`. `TradeDate` and `EntryDate` are only different for trades that take place in the overnight session before midnight. For example, if you look at the first few lines of `DATA` you can tell that these are the first trades and quotes from the beginning of the overnight trading session. These trades take place on calendar date 2011-01-09, but are recorded as trades on contract settlement day 2011-01-10 since daily settlement happens at the end of the daytime session (1:15pm CST). 

**TradeTime**

`TradeTime` is a character string that contains the time the trade or quote took place - to the second. It is in format `%H:%m:%s`. For example, the first line reads `130604`, that is 1:06:04pm CST.

**TradeSeqNum**

`TradeSeqNum` is simply a running index of the trades and quotes as they occur in sequence. For some reason, this variable always increments by 10. Prior to 2012, CME had the practice of copying both the bid and ask when one changes. For example, if someone cancels a limit order to sell, the ask line will change. The quantity offered goes down by the order size that was canceled and the ask price may go up if it was the only limit order to sell at the top of the book. So in the BBO dataset a new ask must be recorded for the top of the book and the `TradeSeqNum` is incremented by 10. In addition, the best bid information is simply copied with the new `TradeSeqNum`. This makes building the top-of-the-book easy for data prior to 2012. Beginning in 2012, the data no longer contian the bid or ask that was unchanged, they only record the bid if the best bid was revised and the only record the ask if the best ask was revised. Also, `TradeSeqNum` no longer increments by 10. An example of building the top-of-the-book for both the pre-2012 and post-2012 case follows in the [Useful Scripts][] section.

**DeliveryDate** 

This variable identifies which maturity futures contract the row is recorded for. Format is `%Y%m` so that `1103` stands for the March 2011 delivery contract. 

**TrQuantity**

This variable contains the size of the bid, ask, or transaction.

**TrPrice**

This variable contains the price of the bid, ask, or transaction. This variable is a character string with leading zeros before displaying the price in cents per bushel. A quirk of these markets is that prices are quoted to the eighth of a cent and the last character of this price variable represents the fraction of an eighth of a cent. For example a price of `0005956` represents `595 + 6/8 = 595.75` cents per bushel. This package contains a function called `decimalprices()` that converts this variable to a decimal for you. An example will follow in this vinette. 

**ASKBID**

This column identifies if the row represents an ask ('A'), bid ('B'), or transaction ('NA').

## Showcasing the Custom BBOTools Functions

This section provides detailed examples of how to execute tasks common to the analysis of the BBO data. 

### `decimalprices()`: Converting 1/8th of a cent 'Ticks' to Decimal 

For the grains and oilseeds futures contracts prices are quoted in 1/4 of a cent increments and the last character of the `TrPrice` variable is the numerator in of the fraction expressed as 1/8th of a cent. For example, the only numbers that apper as last character in the `TrPrice` column are 0, 2, 4, and 6 representing 0/8 = 0.00, 2/8 = 0.25, 4/8 = 0.5, and 6/8 = 0.75. 

The function `decimalprices()` takes the column `TrPrice` and converts the character string to a floating decimal price and automatically handles the fraction of a cent issue from the first column. 


```{r}
DATA[, Price := decimalprices(DATA$TrPrice)]
DATA

```



### `RollContracts()`: Rolling Contracts to Create a Nearby Series

A common task is to string together a series of 'nearby' or 'first deferred' contracts. In this package the function `RollContracts(accum, r)` takes a `data.table` object or a list of `data.table` objects for different dates and identifies which contracts are the nearby, first deferred, and second deferred. More distan contracts than these are removed. The value `r` can be set to specify the date of the month prior to expiration on which the roll should occur. The 20th is the default. A new column called `Deferreds` is created, allowing the nearby contract across multiple days to be strung together to form a nearby series. 

```{r}
accum <- as.list(NULL)
accum[[1]] <- DATA
accum[[2]] <- DATA                 # accum is a list of two 'days' worth of BBO data
accum <- RollContracts(accum, r = 20)
accum

```

### `minutebins()`: Break Trading Day into Ten Minute Bins

Sometimes you want to isolate market effects at specific times of the day. Often, the market open and market close are of particular interest. The function `minutebins(x , minutes)` takes a `data.table` object and the size of the minute bins, `minutes = 10` is the default. It takes the timestamp and rounds to the nearest minute interval allowing you to easily focus on market activity that happens exclusively in specific time minute intervals. For example, suppose you want to analyze the bid-ask spread on the market open. This function easily allows you to subset for a number of minutes directly after the market open. This is accomplished without much computing time because we manipulate the date and time character strings without converting to a date class. Converting to a date class alone takes a lot of time for R to accomplish, so if you can do subset by date or time without converting to a date class, you save a lot of time. 

```{r}
DATA[, bins := minutebins(DATA, 10)]
DATA

```

### `datemanip()` and `timemanip()` for Converting to IDate Class Objects. 

As mentioned in the discussion of the `minutebins()` function, converting the date and time variables is costly in terms of computing time; however it is often unavoidable at some point in our analysis. Particularly if you want to include any plots of time series analysis, you need the x-axis to be specified as a variable in one of the time classes. From a computing time perspective, this is best to be done after your analysis is performed and you want to plot some kind of aggregated results. For example, perhaps I want to plot the number of transactions per day. You can first compute the number of transactions per day before converting the date variable to a date object. Now you have something that has only one observation per day. This will be less time consuming to convert to a date object. 

```{r}

DATA[, c("TradeDate", "TradeTime") := .(datemanip(TradeDate), timemanip(TradeTime))]
DATA

```

## Useful Scripts

In this section we will discuss some tasks that are commonly required for analysis on BBO data including building the top-of-the-book and computing the bid-ask-spread (BAS), looping over daily data files to build a large `data.table` object with many days worth of data, creating a summary plot with price, number of revisions to the bids, revisions to asks, and transactions. 

### Build Top-of-the-Book and Bid-Ask Spread

A frequent topic of analysis with the BBO data is to examine the bid-ask-spread. The following code creates the BAS by using the `dcast.data.table()` function from the `data.table` package. This function allows you to take the `ASKBID` column and create a new column for each factor that exists in the `ASKBID` column.  

```{r, warning= FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
DT <- dcast.data.table(DATA, TradeDate + TradeTime + TradeSeqNum + DeliveryDate + EntryDate + bins ~ ASKBID, 
                       value.var = c("TrQuantity", "Price"))

DT[, BAS := (Price_A - Price_B)]
DT

BAS_plot <- qplot(DT[DeliveryDate == 1103, as.POSIXct("2011-01-10") + TradeTime], DT[DeliveryDate == 1103, BAS],
                  ylim = c(-0.25, 2), xlab = NULL, ylab = "BAS")

BAS_plot
```

We can see that on this day, January 10th, 2011, the BAS ranged from 0 to 1 cent and spent most of its time at 0.25 cents, which is one tick (minimum allowable price fluctuation) in this market. 

This script works for building the top-of-the book prior to 2012, but in 2012 the CME Group changed the format of the BBO data so that it does not record the bid and ask that is unchanged. Let us see what the `DT` looks like if we try to build the top-of-the-book for dates after 2012. Note that you can only follow along with this portion of the vinette if you have access to the proprietary data from CME's Historical Datamine. First load one of the datasets using the `DATA <- as.data.table(bboread('filepath'))` command from earlier in the vinette. For this example I am reading the large dataset in with `readr`'s `read_fwf()` function so I can specify `nmax = 500000` and have a less memory intensive example. Then, similar code is executed as what we did earlier. Notice that now there are many missing values, `NA`, after we cast the data.table. 

The `fill()` function from the `tidyr` package takes missing values and fills in the previous value. Since an unchanged bid or ask is what produces the `NA`'s this is exactly what we need to do to build the top of the book. Then we can compute the BAS is a similar way as we did before. 
 

```{r}

rm(DATA)
start <- c(1, 9, 15, 28, 32, 45, 53, 65)
end   <- c(8, 14, 22, 31, 36, 51, 53, 70)
  
DATA <- readr::read_fwf('C:/Users/mallorym/BBOCORNDATA/2012Jan-2013Nov_txt/BBO_CBT_20120102-20131130_9552_00.TXT', 
                         readr::fwf_positions(start, end, col_names = c("TradeDate", "TradeTime", "TradeSeqNum",
                                                                            "DeliveryDate", "TrQuantity", "TrPrice",
                                                                            "ASKBID", "EntryDate")),
                          col_types = readr::cols(
                            TradeDate = readr::col_character(),
                            TradeTime = readr::col_character(),
                            TradeSeqNum = readr::col_integer(),
                            DeliveryDate = readr::col_character(),
                            TrQuantity = readr::col_integer(),
                            TrPrice = readr::col_character(),
                            ASKBID = readr::col_character(),
                            EntryDate = readr::col_character()
                            ## Put this back into function bboread

                          ), n_max = 500000, progress=FALSE)
DATA <- as.data.table(DATA) 
DATA[, Price := decimalprices(DATA$TrPrice)]
DATA[, bins := minutebins(DATA, 10)]

DT <- dcast.data.table(DATA, 
                       TradeDate + TradeTime + TradeSeqNum + DeliveryDate + EntryDate + bins ~ ASKBID, 
                       value.var = c("TrQuantity", "Price"))
rm(DATA)
# data.table syntax does not work properly. tidyr functions must not be callable by data.table objects for some reason
# DT[, c("TrQuantity_A", "TrQuantity_B", "Price_A", "Price_B") := .(fill(TrQuantity_A), fill(TqQuantity_B), fill(Price_A), fill(Price_B))]

# The following is making copies of DT in memory, but I don't know of a solution right now. 
DT <- fill(DT, TrQuantity_A:Price_B, -TrQuantity_NA)
DT[, BAS := (Price_A - Price_B)]
tqdata <- DT[!is.na(Price_NA) , c("diff1", "diff2") := .(diff(Price_NA, lag = 1), diff(Price_NA, lag = 2))]
```
